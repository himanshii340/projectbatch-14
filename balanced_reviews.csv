They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage.

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower...

I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"

"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.

Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.

"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!

"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.

Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower...

I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"

"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!

"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!

"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"

"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma.

"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.

Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.

"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"

Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)

"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it!

These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!

"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)

Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!

"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)

"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described.

Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni

"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute

First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!

"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"

"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni

D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."

"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast!

"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.

"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni

"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"

I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"

"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!

These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D

First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D

First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"

"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."

love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."

Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√© 
Merci"
"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"

"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.

Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√© 
Merci"
"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"

"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it

I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

"Vraiment ravie de ce choix ! Les deux anneaux sont absolument magnifiques, avec de belles couleurs profondes, et sont tr√®s agr√©ables √† porter.

I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"

"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it

"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"

"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!

"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√© 
Merci"
"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"

"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"

"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry

Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

"This is my second purchase from this shop, and it won't be the last.  The enamel is nicely done, with beautiful colors.  I recommend the red for a beginning try."
The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service!

Love them!
"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni

"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"

"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"

I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni

"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"

"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"

"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!"
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!"
Very cute and unique!
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!

"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)

"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni

First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"

Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

"This is my second purchase from this shop, and it won't be the last.  The enamel is nicely done, with beautiful colors.  I recommend the red for a beginning try."
The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service!
Sincerely Yours,

Catharina Hassid"
Love them!
"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!"
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!"
Very cute and unique!
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
"Sehr sch√∂ne und sorgf√§ltig gearbeitete Ohrstecker, schneller Versand - besten Dank!"
Sehr sch√∂n gearbeitete Ohrringe. Schaut gut aus!
Sieht wundersch√∂n am Ohr aus..tolle Verarbeitung und schnelle Lieferung. Perfekt

"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"

"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D

First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service!

Love them!
"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!"
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!"
Very cute and unique!
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
"Sehr sch√∂ne und sorgf√§ltig gearbeitete Ohrstecker, schneller Versand - besten Dank!"
Sehr sch√∂n gearbeitete Ohrringe. Schaut gut aus!
Sieht wundersch√∂n am Ohr aus..tolle Verarbeitung und schnelle Lieferung. Perfekt
Ravie de mon achat! J'ai pu r√©parer quelques d√©cos de sapin qu'on ne pouvait plus accrocher.  Je n'√©tais pas s√ªre du diam√®tre √† choisir et finalement c'est parfait pour cette utilisation.  Livraison super rapide qui plus est!
Bracelet tr√®s beau et tr√®s bien r√©alis√© !
"Tr√®s bonne qualit√© de fil, et la couleur est extraordinaire ! Je cherchais depuis longtemps des teintes aussi vives et lumineuses, notamment dans la gamme des jaunes et les coloris propos√©s dans cette boutique sont vraiment tr√®s beaux.
Exp√©dition rapide, colis impeccable, bref, une commande parfaite !"
Les couleurs sont top !!! Merci pour le petite plus. Je recommande !!

"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!

"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)

"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.

"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni

"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

"This is my second purchase from this shop, and it won't be the last.  The enamel is nicely done, with beautiful colors.  I recommend the red for a beginning try."
The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service!

Love them!
"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!"
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!"
Very cute and unique!
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
"Sehr sch√∂ne und sorgf√§ltig gearbeitete Ohrstecker, schneller Versand - besten Dank!"
Sehr sch√∂n gearbeitete Ohrringe. Schaut gut aus!
Sieht wundersch√∂n am Ohr aus..tolle Verarbeitung und schnelle Lieferung. Perfekt
Ravie de mon achat! J'ai pu r√©parer quelques d√©cos de sapin qu'on ne pouvait plus accrocher.  Je n'√©tais pas s√ªre du diam√®tre √† choisir et finalement c'est parfait pour cette utilisation.  Livraison super rapide qui plus est!
Bracelet tr√®s beau et tr√®s bien r√©alis√© !
"Tr√®s bonne qualit√© de fil, et la couleur est extraordinaire ! Je cherchais depuis longtemps des teintes aussi vives et lumineuses, notamment dans la gamme des jaunes et les coloris propos√©s dans cette boutique sont vraiment tr√®s beaux.

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.

"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)

"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!

The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation. Et le r√©sultat √©tait g√©nial! rien √† redire, j'en ai d√©j√† command√© 3! un grand merci!"
"Vraiment ravie de ce choix ! Les deux anneaux sont absolument magnifiques, avec de belles couleurs profondes, et sont tr√®s agr√©ables √† porter. Ils donnent une ""signature"" toute nouvelle √† mes cheveux courts. Les √©changes avec la cr√©atrice ont √©t√© tr√®s plaisants et l'envoi imm√©diat.

"This is my second purchase from this shop, and it won't be the last.  The enamel is nicely done, with beautiful colors.  I recommend the red for a beginning try."
The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service!
Sincerely Yours,

Catharina Hassid"
Love them!
"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!"
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!"
Very cute and unique!
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
"Sehr sch√∂ne und sorgf√§ltig gearbeitete Ohrstecker, schneller Versand - besten Dank!"
Sehr sch√∂n gearbeitete Ohrringe. Schaut gut aus!
Sieht wundersch√∂n am Ohr aus..tolle Verarbeitung und schnelle Lieferung. Perfekt
Ravie de mon achat! J'ai pu r√©parer quelques d√©cos de sapin qu'on ne pouvait plus accrocher.  Je n'√©tais pas s√ªre du diam√®tre √† choisir et finalement c'est parfait pour cette utilisation.  Livraison super rapide qui plus est!
Bracelet tr√®s beau et tr√®s bien r√©alis√© !
"Tr√®s bonne qualit√© de fil, et la couleur est extraordinaire ! Je cherchais depuis longtemps des teintes aussi vives et lumineuses, notamment dans la gamme des jaunes et les coloris propos√©s dans cette boutique sont vraiment tr√®s beaux.
Exp√©dition rapide, colis impeccable, bref, une commande parfaite !"
Les couleurs sont top !!! Merci pour le petite plus. Je recommande !!
These earrings are beautiful! They look amazing! The overseas shipping was really fast too. Thank you.
Really beautiful!!!
Super cute! It took kind of a long time to get here but it was worth the wait!
"So so gorgeous, love it!"
"wow! joanna, thanx ever so much for all the work and creativity you put into to my beautiful earrings. what a pleasure it was to work with you. i sincerely appreciate your ‚Äúadditional creativity‚Äù in making my earrings specific to my requests. looking forward to additional one-of-a-kind pieces!"
"This seller is incredible. I had a custom ring made for my beloved with a very specific vision in mind. When I received the ring at first, it didn't turn out how I had wanted it. The seller provided exactly what I had asked for, so no fault on their end, it just wasn't exactly what I had envisioned. I messaged the seller about it and they were so helpful and patient with me. They offered to remake the ring at no extra cost . In very short time, the seller was able to recreate the ring and send the new one to me. This ring is absolutely everything I wanted to give to my other half. The work is so beautiful, and it looks very carefully made, down to the last detail. I am very grateful to have picked the seller that I did. Outstanding customer service! I would absolutely order from them again. Thank you for everything you've done!"
"I had this ring saved in my favorites for over a year. Finally took the plunge and I'm so glad I did! It's so dainty, romantic and slightly minimalist. Just my style! The moonstone is cut gorgeously with a slight rainbow tinge to it. The fit is perfect and it came just in time! The seller responded promptly to my questions. Great experience overall ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"So beautiful in person. I was surprised at how well they stayed in place, given the backing type. Really pleased with my purchase."
"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
These ear climbers are so beautiful! They‚Äôre perfect for my second ear holes.
I absolutely love these earrings!! I wear them almost every day. They are so comfortable... I‚Äôd love to get them in a different metal one day :). Thank you!!
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
Love them üòç
I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I‚Äôd definitely purchase more from this shop
"I purchased the S for my first initial and it‚Äôs so beautiful. I wear it all the time, even in the shower."
"Love this earring! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than I expected, but still so beautiful!"
Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"Absolutely Beautiful!!! My second pair, Covid Mask I was wearing pulled one out and it was lost...Happy to have another pair!!!"
Love it
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
"Prachtige earclimbers, mooi ingepakt, met zilverdoekje bijgesloten,snelle verzending, echte aanrader."
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
"Son geniales!!! Auque creo que los prete demasiado y se me cedi√≥ un poco el agujero. Hay que medir bien en que agujero los poner.
Por lo demas ideales!!!"
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
Perfectly beautiful!
"Love these mandala earrings:  delicate design, light and comfortable to wear.  Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe!  Highly recommended!"
"I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"Love! The only thing is apparently my piercings are to high because the lotus part doesn‚Äôt show real well, but the earrings are still great!"
Love these! It came with three earrings and I‚Äôm not sure if it was an accident or maybe she always gives an extra? Haha but they are super cute
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
"Absolutely love!  Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
Absolutely love these earrings!  They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful.  the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning.  the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles.
Malheureusement une des tiges est arriv√©e tordue."
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
"Tr√®s belles boucles, je les porte tout le temps!Conformes √† la photo. Bon √† savoir qunand m√™me : le fermoir est en crochet et non pas en ""clou"" ou papillon, il arrive donc qu'elles glissent et se mettent en ""dormeuses""."
Bought both gold + silver climbers‚Äî-LUV them!  Subtle + classy yet fun.  Size + wuality = perfect!
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
Really love these earrings!  And there are so many different combinations that can be achieved even with other earrings I already own!
"My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon!
Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!"
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix.
Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier.
Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"the pic here does not show the beauty, I received my ring 
today, and it is very beautiful.  Thank you all, will certainly
purchase more items from this store."
Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Bellissimi, ottima manifattura, brava, sono magnifici"
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Loved the ear crawlers! They were exactly as pictured in your merchandise listing and looked amazing on my ears.
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
"Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©

"Le bracelet est juste PARFAIT, Rachel est √† l'√©coute,son travail est g√©niale, je porte ses bijoux depuis de longues ann√©es et je les aiment toujours autant.Merci Rachel pour tout mes petits tr√©sors."
"La po√©sie de cette bague, la puret√© douce de ce galet m'ont √©mue ! Quelle joie en la d√©couvrant, je suis si fi√®re de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talentüëç"
"Je suis toujours ravie des cr√©ations de Rachel car les pierres choisies sont sublimes et, d√®s que je re√ßois mon bijoux, je reste sans voix !"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
"Great buy! Quality, style, and promptness of delivery were all A+. I, a person given to self-denial in areas like jewelry, bought one of these after stalking it on here for some time, loved it, lost it promptly, and wasted absolutely no time buying another."
They are so pretty.  I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ??  Thank you Amy
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different.
Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get.
Thank you so much.
Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
D√©licate et parfaite c‚Äôest ma troisi√®me commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle √† qui j‚Äôen ai parl√© parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d‚Äôune des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entr√©. Avec mon oreille c‚Äôest celui qui me convient.On me dit que la m√®che est utilis√© pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoy√© la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis d√©√ßue du service apr√®s vente.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
love these earrings.  So pretty.  They are a little hard to keep on my ears because my earlobes are small but they are so pretty and they standout.
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring! This is what I‚Äôve been looking for for a while. Wearing it in the same spot as the photo.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
I cannot express how wonderful these are. Thank you so much!
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
"ME ENCANTAN mis nuevos aretes!!! son PERFECTOS!!! Excelente calidad, llegaron en perfecto estado a mi hogar."
Absolutely love these!!! Very good quality and it matches a lot of my outfits! üòçüòçüòçüòç
Super happy with my earrings they are really cute and very well nade
I have several pairs and I mix and match them. It's great fun! I couldn't be more pleased and I was given several extra pairs which was such a nice treat!!!
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

Thank you!!"
I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.
"Very nice, looks exactly as shown!!"
Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
Unique and I love them üòç
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
"These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I‚Äôve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!"
"So pleased - just the right length for me, and extremely versatile, mixing with different earrings to give lots of different looks"
This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I bought it.
"This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!"
"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie sup√©rieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les cr√©ation de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite √©t√© int√©ress√© et j'ai demand√© une personnalisation.

"Vraiment ravie de ce choix ! Les deux anneaux sont absolument magnifiques, avec de belles couleurs profondes, et sont tr√®s agr√©ables √† porter.

"This is my second purchase from this shop, and it won't be the last.  The enamel is nicely done, with beautiful colors.  I recommend the red for a beginning try."
The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service!

Catharina Hassid"
Love them!
"Sehr sch√∂ne Ear Crawler, allerdings relativ lange Lieferzeit (14 Tage) f√ºr den Versand innerhalb der EU- da kam die Bestellung aus New York bedeutend schneller. Dennoch- w√ºrde sie wieder bestellen!"
These are beautiful and look just like picture. Arrived in a short time. I love them.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
Worth the wait -- beautiful!
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. 

Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!"
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!"
Very cute and unique!
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
"Sehr sch√∂ne und sorgf√§ltig gearbeitete Ohrstecker, schneller Versand - besten Dank!"
Sehr sch√∂n gearbeitete Ohrringe. Schaut gut aus!
Sieht wundersch√∂n am Ohr aus..tolle Verarbeitung und schnelle Lieferung. Perfekt
Ravie de mon achat! J'ai pu r√©parer quelques d√©cos de sapin qu'on ne pouvait plus accrocher.  Je n'√©tais pas s√ªre du diam√®tre √† choisir et finalement c'est parfait pour cette utilisation.  Livraison super rapide qui plus est!
Bracelet tr√®s beau et tr√®s bien r√©alis√© !
"Tr√®s bonne qualit√© de fil, et la couleur est extraordinaire ! Je cherchais depuis longtemps des teintes aussi vives et lumineuses, notamment dans la gamme des jaunes et les coloris propos√©s dans cette boutique sont vraiment tr√®s beaux.
Exp√©dition rapide, colis impeccable, bref, une commande parfaite !"
Les couleurs sont top !!! Merci pour le petite plus. Je recommande !!
These earrings are beautiful! They look amazing! The overseas shipping was really fast too. Thank you.
Really beautiful!!!
Super cute! It took kind of a long time to get here but it was worth the wait!
"So so gorgeous, love it!"
"wow! joanna, thanx ever so much for all the work and creativity you put into to my beautiful earrings. what a pleasure it was to work with you. i sincerely appreciate your ‚Äúadditional creativity‚Äù in making my earrings specific to my requests. looking forward to additional one-of-a-kind pieces!"
"This seller is incredible. I had a custom ring made for my beloved with a very specific vision in mind. When I received the ring at first, it didn't turn out how I had wanted it. The seller provided exactly what I had asked for, so no fault on their end, it just wasn't exactly what I had envisioned. I messaged the seller about it and they were so helpful and patient with me. They offered to remake the ring at no extra cost . In very short time, the seller was able to recreate the ring and send the new one to me. This ring is absolutely everything I wanted to give to my other half. The work is so beautiful, and it looks very carefully made, down to the last detail. I am very grateful to have picked the seller that I did. Outstanding customer service! I would absolutely order from them again. Thank you for everything you've done!"
"I had this ring saved in my favorites for over a year. Finally took the plunge and I'm so glad I did! It's so dainty, romantic and slightly minimalist. Just my style! The moonstone is cut gorgeously with a slight rainbow tinge to it. The fit is perfect and it came just in time! The seller responded promptly to my questions. Great experience overall ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"So beautiful in person. I was surprised at how well they stayed in place, given the backing type. Really pleased with my purchase."
"Super cute, and actually looks really cute as a climber. 
One note - they are much much tinier than I anticipated. Refer to the picture on an actual ear, not the bowl picture :D"
"I love my super chic ear pin climbers. They are well-made, and were packed so sweetly. I'm a regular LITTIONARY customer and will continue to be after this purchase!"
They are small and absolutely perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for when I don't want to clash wearing silver and gold jewelry (I hate doing that). They shipped extremely fast!

These earrings are so lovely and I've been wearing them all the time since I got them. Beautiful packaging too.
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
"I love them! Very pretty, moonstone is MUCh shinier than anticipated!"
"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"

Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower...

Bought for my daughter-in-law. Absolutely gorgeous!
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
